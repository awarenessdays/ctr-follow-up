## üéØ Key Insights

The dashboard reveals several critical findings about AI Overviews impact:

- **Universal Impact**: Both informational and transactional queries show significant CTR decline
- **Device Differential**: Desktop queries experience higher impact than mobile
- **Length Correlation**: 6-7 word queries show maximum decline (-54-56%)
- **Brand Protection**: Branded queries maintain or improve performance while non-brand queries decline dramatically
- **Timeline Correlation**: Each AI Overviews rollout phase correlates with measurable CTR decline acceleration

## üîß Customization
